#one pager, form and small graphic charter

Name of the repo on GitHub: `recap-html-css`.

In groups of 2 for the until the 21st of September
Create a website for a shop or a fictional craftsman in HTML and CSS including 4 sections:
- welcome**: information on the activity of the craftsman or shop
- services** or **products**: image gallery AND/OR a table with services and prices
- where to find us**: integration of a google map's picture (you have to pay for the API now) with a fictitious address (if you really have no imagination, put: Olavarría 143, 1879 Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina
)
- Contact: basic contact form

#### For the form
It would be necessary:
- radio buttons** (for example: madam, sir)
- name fields
- email address fields
- checkboxes** (products that interest the visitor?)
- a field that allows you to **select**ionner among three **options** (for example: quote, complaint, love letter, request for information,...)
- a field for the user to write long messages
- a **button** to send
- a **fieldset** to make it look nice

#### For texts
Use **Lorem Ipsum**.

Or if you have time, write short texts for the content of their mini site. If possible, without spelling mistakes.

#### For the photos
- Use royalty-free images
- Use at Gimp to crop, resize images. Other alternative =>[Pixlr Editor](https://pixlr.com/editor/)

#### For the logo: 
Use a[free logo generator] (https://www.hipsterlogogenerator.com) (link as an example but there are others) and respect your own graphic charter.
